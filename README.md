# Project1: Sunny Weekend

People don't like making decisions, but travel planning requires hours upon hours of decision making. Our website will deliver "customized" travel itineraries for a city with good weather this weekend. Carpe diem!

Our first project.

  # Project Description
  
  The user will input some intial data about their current location, budget and preferences for attractions, then spit out an itinerary for a city with good weather that weekend. Itineraries are going to be pulled from highly rated places on Trip Advisor. There will also be options to remix a different vacation if the user wants to change something.
